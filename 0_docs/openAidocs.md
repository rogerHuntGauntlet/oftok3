An open-source Client package that allows developers to easily integrate the power of OpenAI's state-of-the-art AI models into their Dart/Flutter applications.

This library provides simple and intuitive methods for making requests to OpenAI's various APIs, including the GPT-3 language model, DALL-E image generation, and more.

The package is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, so you can focus on building your application, rather than worrying about the complexities and errors caused by dealing with HTTP requests.



Unofficial
OpenAI does not have any official Dart library.

üü¢ Usage 
Authentication 
API key 
The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. you can get your account API key by visiting API keys of your account.

We highly recommend loading your secret key at runtime from a .env file, you can use the envied package or any other package that does the same job.

// .env
OPEN_AI_API_KEY=<REPLACE WITH YOUR API KEY>
// lib/env/env.dart
import 'package:envied/envied.dart';
part 'env.g.dart';

@Envied(path: ".env")
abstract class Env {
  @EnviedField(varName: 'OPEN_AI_API_KEY') // the .env variable.
  static const apiKey = _Env.apiKey;
}
// lib/main.dart
void main() {
 OpenAI.apiKey = Env.apiKey; // Initializes the package with that API key, all methods now are ready for use.
 // ..
}
if no apiKey is set, and you tried to access OpenAI.instance, a MissingApiKeyException will be thrown even before making the actual request.

if the apiKey is set, but it is invalid when making requests, a RequestFailedException will be thrown in your app, check the error handling section for more info.

Setting an organization 
if you belong to a specific organization, you can pass its id to OpenAI.organization like this:

 OpenAI.organization = "ORGANIZATION ID";
If you don't belong actually to any organization, you can just ignore this section, or set it to null.

Settings a default request timeout 
The package make use if the http to make requests, this one have a default timeout of 30 seconds, this means that any requests that takes more than 30 seconds will be cancelled, and a exception will be thrown, to chenge that you will need to set your own default timeout:

OpenAI.requestsTimeOut = Duration(seconds: 60); // 60 seconds.
And now, the time consuming methods will wait for 60 seconds to get a response before throwing an exception.

Setting your own base url 
You can change the base url used in the package to your own, this can be helpful if you want to proxy the requests to the OpenAI API, or if you want to use your own server as a proxy to the OpenAI API.

OpenAI.baseUrl = "https://api.openai.com/v1"; // the default one.
Enable debugging and logs 
You can make the package logs the operations flows and steps by setting the showLogs:

OpenAI.showLogs = true;
This will only log the requests steps such when the request started and finished, when the decoding started...

But if you want to log raw responses that are returned from the API (JSON, RAW...), you can set the showResponsesLogs:

OpenAI.showResponsesLogs = true;
This will log the raw responses that are returned from the API, such when the request is successful, or when it failed. (This don't include the stream responses).

Models 
List Models 
Lists the currently available models, and provides information about each one such as the owner and availability.

List<OpenAIModelModel> models = await OpenAI.instance.model.list();
OpenAIModelModel firstModel = models.first;
 
print(firstModel.id); // ...
print(firstModel.permission); // ...
Retrieve model 
Retrieves a single model by its id and gets additional pieces of information about it.

OpenAIModelModel model = await OpenAI.instance.model.retrieve("text-davinci-003");

print(model.ownedBy); // ...
If the model id you provided does not exist or isn't available for your account, a RequestFailedException will be thrown, check Error Handling section.

Delete fine tuned models 
OpenAI offers fine tuning feature, which you can make use of it with this package here.

However, if it happen that you want to delete a fine tuned model, you can use the delete() method:

bool isDeleted = await OpenAI.instance.model.delete("fine-tune-id");

print(isDeleted); // ...

Completions 
Create completion 
Creates a predicted completion based on the provided model, prompt & other properties asynchronously.

OpenAICompletionModel completion = await OpenAI.instance.completion.create(
  model: "text-davinci-003",
  prompt: "Dart is a program",
  maxTokens: 20,
  temperature: 0.5,
  n: 1,
  stop: ["\n"],
  echo: true,
  seed: 42,
  bestOf: 2,
);

print(completion.choices.first.text); // ...
print(completion.systemFingerprint); // ...
print(completion.id); // ...

if the request failed (as an example, if you did pass an invalid model...), a RequestFailedException will be thrown, check Error Handling section.

Create Completion Stream 
In addition to calling the OpenAI.instance.completion.create() which is a Future (asynchronous) and will not return an actual value until the full completion is generated, you can get a Stream of them as they happen to be generated:

Stream<OpenAIStreamCompletionModel> completionStream = OpenAI.instance.completion.createStream(
  model: "text-davinci-003",
  prompt: "Github is ",
  maxTokens: 100,
  temperature: 0.5,
  topP: 1,
  seed: 42,
  stop: '###',
  n: 2,
);

completionStream.listen((event) {
  final firstCompletionChoice = event.choices.first;

  print(firstCompletionChoice.index); // ...
  print(firstCompletionChoice.text); // ...
});
Useful: Check also the createStreamText() method

Chat (ChatGPT) 
Create chat completion 
Creates a predicted completion for a chat message(s), from the provided properties:

// the system message that will be sent to the request.
final systemMessage = OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageModel(
  content: [
    OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageContentItemModel.text(
      "return any message you are given as JSON.",
    ),
  ],
  role: OpenAIChatMessageRole.assistant,
);

  // the user message that will be sent to the request.
 final userMessage = OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageModel(
   content: [
     OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageContentItemModel.text(
       "Hello, I am a chatbot created by OpenAI. How are you today?",
     ),

     //! image url contents are allowed only for models with image support such gpt-4.
     OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageContentItemModel.imageUrl(
       "https://placehold.co/600x400",
     ),
   ],
   role: OpenAIChatMessageRole.user,
 );

// all messages to be sent.
final requestMessages = [
  systemMessage,
  userMessage,
];

// the actual request.
OpenAIChatCompletionModel chatCompletion = await OpenAI.instance.chat.create(
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
  responseFormat: {"type": "json_object"},
  seed: 6,
  messages: requestMessages,
  temperature: 0.2,
  maxTokens: 500,
);

print(chatCompletion.choices.first.message); // ...
print(chatCompletion.systemFingerprint); // ...
print(chatCompletion.usage.promptTokens); // ...
print(chatCompletion.id); // ...
Create a chat completion stream 
In addition to calling OpenAI.instance.chat.create() which is a Future (asynchronous) and will resolve only after the whole chat is generated, you can get a Stream of them as they happen to be generated:

// The user message to be sent to the request.
final userMessage = OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageModel(
  content: [
    OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageContentItemModel.text(
      "Hello my friend!",
    ),
  ],
  role: OpenAIChatMessageRole.user,
);

// The request to be sent.
final chatStream = OpenAI.instance.chat.createStream(
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages: [
    userMessage,
  ],
  seed: 423,
  n: 2,
);

// Listen to the stream.
chatStream.listen(
  (streamChatCompletion) {
    final content = streamChatCompletion.choices.first.delta.content;
    print(content);
  },
  onDone: () {
    print("Done");
  },
);

Tools ( new implementation of functions calling) 
The chat API offer the tools feature which allows for calling functions from the chat API, this feature is implemented in the package, and can be used like the following, please note that this is just a showcase, and you should handle the edge cases in your app such when there is no tool call, or when the tool call is not the one you sent, etc...:

 OpenAI.apiKey = Env.apiKey;

// The function to be called by the tool.
void sumNumbers(int number1, int number2) {
  print("Your sum answer is ${number1 + number2}");
}

// The tool object that wilm be sent to the API.
final sumNumbersTool = OpenAIToolModel(
    type: "function",
  function: OpenAIFunctionModel.withParameters(
    name: "sumOfTwoNumbers",
    parameters: [
      OpenAIFunctionProperty.integer(
        name: "number1",
        description: "The first number to add",
      ),
      OpenAIFunctionProperty.integer(
        name: "number2",
        description: "The second number to add",
      ),
    ],
  ),
);

  // The user text message that will be sent to the API.
final userMessage = OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageModel(
    content: [
    OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageContentItemModel.text(
        "What is the sum of 9996 and 3?",
      ),
  ],
    role: OpenAIChatMessageRole.user,
);

  // The actual call.
final chat = await OpenAI.instance.chat.create(
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [userMessage],
    tools: [sumNumbersTool],
);

// ! This handling is only for showcase and not completed as edge cases will not be handled that you should handle in your app.

final message = chat.choices.first.message;

// Wether the message has a tool call.
  if (message.haveToolCalls) {
  final call = message.toolCalls!.first;

    // Wether the tool call is the one we sent.
  if (call.function.name == "sumOfTwoNumbers") {
      // decode the arguments from the tool call.
    final decodedArgs = jsonDecode(call.function.arguments);

    final number1 = decodedArgs["number1"];
    final number2 = decodedArgs["number2"];

    // Call the function with the arguments.
    sumNumbers(number1, number2);
  }
  }

Audio 
Create Speech 
For creating a speech from a text, you can use the createSpeech() method directly by providing the required params:

// The speech request.
File speechFile = await OpenAI.instance.audio.createSpeech(
  model: "tts-1",
  input: "Say my name is Anas",
  voice: "nova",
  responseFormat: OpenAIAudioSpeechResponseFormat.mp3,
  outputDirectory: await Directory("speechOutput").create(),
  outputFileName: "anas",
);

// The file result.
print(speechFile.path);
Note: the outputDirectory and outputFileName are helpers for this method, you can use them to save the audio file to a specific directory with a specific name, with the file extension being extracted from the responseFormat. if you don't want to use them, just ignore it, and the audio file will be saved to the default directory of your app, with the output file name.

The example snippet above will place a generated anas.mp3 in the speechOutput directory in your project.

Create transcription 
For transcribing an audio File, you can use the createTranscription() method directly by providing the file property:

OpenAIAudioModel transcription = OpenAI.instance.audio.createTranscription(
  file: File(/* THE FILE PATH*/),
  model: "whisper-1",
  responseFormat: OpenAIAudioResponseFormat.json,
);

// print the transcription.
print(transcription.text);
Create translation 
to get access to the translation API, and translate an audio file to english, you can use the createTranslation() method, by providing the `file`` property:

OpenAIAudioModel translation = await OpenAI.instance.audio.createTranslation(
  file: File(/* THE FILE PATH*/),
  model: "whisper-1",
  responseFormat: OpenAIAudioResponseFormat.text,
);

// print the translation.
print(translation.text);

Error Handling 
Any time an error happens from the OpenAI API ends (As Example: when you try to create an image variation from a non-image file.. , a RequestFailedException will be thrown automatically inside your Flutter / Dart app, you can use a try-catch to catch that error, and make an action based on it:

try {

// This will throw an error.
 final errorVariation = await OpenAI.instance.image.variation(
  image: File(/*PATH OF NON-IMAGE FILE*/),
 );
} on RequestFailedException catch(e) {
 print(e.message);
 print(e.statusCode);
}
