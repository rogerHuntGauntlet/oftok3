# Project Tracking & Popularity Scoring Feature

This document outlines a proposed feature to track project popularity by assigning a score to projects every time a user visits or interacts with them. The goal of this feature is to later use this score for recommendations and for generating AI‑driven content clustering.

---

## Feature Overview

- **Project Visit Tracking:**  
  Every time a user opens a project's details screen, the project receives one score point.

- **Video View Tracking:**  
  When a user watches a video linked to a project (for example, as part of a video feed), the project receives an additional point.

- **Future Possibilities:**  
  The accumulated scores can be used for:
  - Ranking projects by popularity.
  - AI‑powered clustering and recommendations.
  - Visualizing a network of popular projects.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Incrementing the Project Score

We add a helper method in our `ProjectService` to update a numeric field (e.g., `score`) in the Firestore document. Firestore’s `FieldValue.increment()` method is ideal for this purpose because it will create the field if it isn’t present and update it atomically.

#### File: lib/services/project_service.dart

```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
import '../models/project.dart';

class ProjectService {
  final FirebaseFirestore _firestore = FirebaseFirestore.instance;

  // ... existing methods ...

  // Increment the project score by a specified number.
  Future<void> incrementProjectScore(String projectId, int incrementBy) async {
    await _firestore.collection('projects').doc(projectId).update({
      'score': FieldValue.increment(incrementBy),
    });
  }

  // Other methods such as createProject, addVideoToProject, etc.
}
```

---

### 2. Updating the Project Details Screen

When a user opens a project's detail view, we call the new `incrementProjectScore` method to add one point. This can be performed once during the initialization of the screen.

#### File: lib/screens/project_details_screen.dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '../services/project_service.dart';
import '../models/project.dart';

class ProjectDetailsScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  final Project project;

  const ProjectDetailsScreen({Key? key, required this.project}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _ProjectDetailsScreenState createState() => _ProjectDetailsScreenState();
}

class _ProjectDetailsScreenState extends State<ProjectDetailsScreen> {
  final ProjectService _projectService = ProjectService();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Schedule the score increment after the first frame.
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
      _projectService.incrementProjectScore(widget.project.id, 1);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.project.name),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Project details and videos will be displayed here.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### 3. Tracking Video Views Within a Project

For each video associated with a project, you can trigger an additional score increment (e.g., when a video starts playing). This involves modifying the video player widget to call a callback when video playback begins. Then, in the video feed widget, trigger the score increment the first time the video plays.

#### File: lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '../services/project_service.dart';
import '../widgets/video_player_widget.dart';

class VideoFeedItem extends StatefulWidget {
  final String videoUrl;
  final String videoId;
  final String projectId;
  final String projectName;
  final bool autoPlay;

  const VideoFeedItem({
    Key? key,
    required this.videoUrl,
    required this.videoId,
    required this.projectId,
    required this.projectName,
    this.autoPlay = true,
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _VideoFeedItemState createState() => _VideoFeedItemState();
}

class _VideoFeedItemState extends State<VideoFeedItem> {
  final ProjectService _projectService = ProjectService();
  bool _hasTrackedWatch = false;

  void _onVideoStarted() {
    if (!_hasTrackedWatch) {
      _hasTrackedWatch = true;
      // Increment project score for video view.
      _projectService.incrementProjectScore(widget.projectId, 1);
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Stack(
      fit: StackFit.expand,
      children: [
        VideoPlayerWidget(
          key: ValueKey(widget.videoUrl),
          videoUrl: widget.videoUrl,
          autoPlay: widget.autoPlay,
          showControls: true,
          onVideoStarted: _onVideoStarted,
        ),
        // Example overlay for project name.
        Positioned(
          top: MediaQuery.of(context).padding.top + 16,
          left: 16,
          right: 16,
          child: Container(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16, vertical: 8),
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
            ),
            child: Text(
              widget.projectName,
              style: const TextStyle(
                color: Colors.white,
                fontSize: 18,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            ),
          ),
        ),
        // Other UI overlays such as buttons can be added here.
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

#### File: lib/widgets/video_player_widget.dart

Modify your video player widget to include an optional callback when the video starts playing:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

class VideoPlayerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  final String videoUrl;
  final bool autoPlay;
  final bool showControls;
  final VoidCallback? onVideoStarted;

  const VideoPlayerWidget({
    Key? key,
    required this.videoUrl,
    this.autoPlay = false,
    this.showControls = false,
    this.onVideoStarted,
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _VideoPlayerWidgetState createState() => _VideoPlayerWidgetState();
}

class _VideoPlayerWidgetState extends State<VideoPlayerWidget> {
  late VideoPlayerController _controller;
  bool _hasNotifiedStart = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(widget.videoUrl)
      ..initialize().then((_) {
        setState(() {});
        if (widget.autoPlay) {
          _controller.play();
        }
      });

    // Listen for playback start.
    _controller.addListener(() {
      if (!_hasNotifiedStart && _controller.value.isPlaying) {
        _hasNotifiedStart = true;
        widget.onVideoStarted?.call();
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (_controller.value.isInitialized) {
      return AspectRatio(
        aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
        child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
      );
    } else {
      return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
    }
  }
}
```

## Reasoning

- **Maintainability:**  
  Each widget and service now has a clear responsibility. Project score handling is encapsulated in the `ProjectService` and is triggered by interactions from UI widgets.

- **Scalability:**  
  Using Firestore’s atomic increment (`FieldValue.increment()`), we ensure that updates to the project score are efficient and concurrency-safe.

- **Future Integration:**  
  With the score data stored on each project, you can later build enhanced features such as:
  - Popular projects listing.
  - AI‑driven clustering and content recommendations.
  - Visualizations that map connections between popular projects and user behavior.

---

## Feature Set Summary

- **Tracking Mechanism:**
  - Points are added when a user opens a project (1 point per visit).
  - Additional points are added when a video in that project is watched (1 point per video view).

- **Key Components:**
  - A service method (`incrementProjectScore`) to update the Firestore document.
  - Integration with UI elements in both project details and video feed items.
  - Modifications to the video player widget to trigger tracking on playback start.

- **Benefits:**
  - Builds a foundation for analytics and recommendations based on user engagement.
  - Enables dynamic UI responses to popular projects (e.g., highlighting or recommending similar projects).
  - Scalable using Firestore’s built‑in atomic operations and robust updates.

---

## Final Thoughts

This approach not only tracks user interactions in a granular way but also sets the stage for advanced features like AI‑powered recommendations and dynamic clustering of content. By keeping the code modular and using dedicated services for tasks like video playback and project scoring, future maintenance and extension of the app will be more straightforward.

Feel free to adjust the scoring logic (e.g., using different weights for different types of interactions) and integrate additional features as needed.
