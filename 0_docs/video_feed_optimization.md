# VideoFeedScreen Performance Optimization

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of performance optimizations for the VideoFeedScreen component. The goal is to improve video playback performance, reduce memory usage, and enhance the overall user experience.

## Current Issues
1. **Inefficient Player Management**
   - Each video initializes its own player instance
   - No player reuse mechanism
   - Excessive memory usage from multiple active players

2. **Memory Management Issues**
   - Players not properly disposed
   - No limit on concurrent player instances
   - Potential memory leaks during rapid scrolling

3. **State Management Inefficiencies**
   - Frequent setState calls
   - Unnecessary widget rebuilds
   - Lack of proper state isolation

4. **Preloading Strategy Issues**
   - Fixed preload distance regardless of conditions
   - No network-aware loading
   - Inefficient resource usage

## Implementation Checklist

### 1. Player Management Optimization
- [ ] **Player Pool Implementation**
  ```dart
  class PlayerPool {
    final int maxPlayers;
    final Map<String, MediaKitPlayerService> activePlayers;
    final Queue<MediaKitPlayerService> availablePlayers;
    
    // TODO: Implement player checkout/return mechanism
    // TODO: Add player lifecycle management
    // TODO: Implement cleanup strategy
  }
  ```

## Implementation Progress

### Current Status
- Not started
- Awaiting implementation prioritization

### Next Steps
1. Prioritize implementation order
2. Begin with most critical optimizations
3. Implement and test changes incrementally

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization
- Average memory usage: TBD
- Player initialization time: TBD
- Frame drop rate: TBD
- Video load time: TBD

### After Optimization
- Average memory usage: TBD
- Player initialization time: TBD
- Frame drop rate: TBD
- Video load time: TBD

## Notes
- Implementation should be done incrementally
- Each change should be tested thoroughly
- Performance metrics should be collected before and after each major change
- Regular progress updates will be added to this document
