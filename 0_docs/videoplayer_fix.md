Below is an explanation along with a proposed refactor to help you clean up the video feed and make streaming more reliable.

## What’s Going On

Your current code has several responsibilities mixed together:

- It initializes the video player system and page controller.
- It handles preloading of videos.
- It builds the entire video feed UI (video player, project header, comments & save buttons, etc.) all inside one large widget.

This “monolithic” setup can quickly get hard to maintain and may introduce subtle bugs (for example, issues with reinitializing players, performance problems, or lifecycle issues when switching pages).

---

## How to Improve It

### 1. Split Responsibilities into Smaller, Focused Widgets

**a. VideoFeedScreen:**  
Keep this widget focused solely on laying out the feed (using a PageView) and delegating each page to a dedicated widget.

**b. VideoFeedItem:**  
Create a dedicated widget that handles:
- Instantiating a video player provider for the given video.
- Managing UI overlays (project name, comments button, save button, etc.)
- Isolating the video playback logic from the overall feed.

This decoupling makes both music easier to test and more resilient against issues with reinitialization or preloading.

### 2. Delegate Preloading to a Separate Service or Provider

Move the video preloading logic into its own service (or even better, a dedicated provider) so that the VideoFeedScreen simply subscribes to a stream of preloaded players. This way you’re not holding on to multiple responsibilities (page management and player management) in the same widget.

### 3. Utilize a Robust Video Player Solution

If you continue to have reliability issues with streaming (or if MediaKit isn’t behaving as expected), consider switching to a well‑established package like Flutter’s built‑in [`video_player`](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player) (with a UI wrapper like [Chewie](https://pub.dev/packages/chewie)) or another package that includes caching and resource recycling. These packages are battle‑tested and may be more predictable in production environments.

## Proposed Refactor

Below are two key snippets. The first is the new, slimmed‑down **VideoFeedScreen** and the second is a dedicated **VideoFeedItem** widget that encapsulates the video player for each feed item.

### **File: lib/screens/video_feed_screen.dart**

```dart:lib/screens/video_feed_screen.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '../widgets/video_feed_item.dart';

class VideoFeedScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> videoUrls;
  final List<String> videoIds;
  final String projectName;

  const VideoFeedScreen({
    Key? key,
    required this.videoUrls,
    required this.videoIds,
    required this.projectName,
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: Colors.black,
      body: PageView.builder(
        scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
        itemCount: videoUrls.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return VideoFeedItem(
            key: ValueKey(videoUrls[index]),
            videoUrl: videoUrls[index],
            videoId: videoIds[index],
            projectName: projectName,
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### **File: lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart**

```dart:lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import '../services/video/video_player_provider.dart';
import '../services/video/media_kit_player_service.dart';
import '../widgets/video_player_widget.dart';
import '../widgets/save_button.dart';
import '../services/auth_service.dart';
import '../screens/comments_screen.dart';

class VideoFeedItem extends StatelessWidget {
  final String videoUrl;
  final String videoId;
  final String projectName;

  const VideoFeedItem({
    Key? key,
    required this.videoUrl,
    required this.videoId,
    required this.projectName,
  }) : super(key: key);

  void _showComments(BuildContext context) {
    final authService = AuthService();
    if (!authService.isSignedIn) {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        const SnackBar(
          content: Text('Please sign in to comment'),
          backgroundColor: Colors.red,
        ),
      );
      return;
    }

    showModalBottomSheet(
      context: context,
      isScrollControlled: true,
      backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
      builder: (context) => DraggableScrollableSheet(
        initialChildSize: 0.9,
        minChildSize: 0.5,
        maxChildSize: 0.9,
        builder: (_, controller) => Hero(
          tag: 'comments_$videoId',
          child: Material(
            color: Colors.transparent,
            child: CommentsScreen(
              videoId: videoId,
              userId: authService.currentUserId!,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => VideoPlayerProvider(factory: MediaKitPlayerFactory()),
      child: Consumer<VideoPlayerProvider>(
        builder: (context, provider, child) {
          return Stack(
            fit: StackFit.expand,
            children: [
              VideoPlayerWidget(
                videoUrl: videoUrl,
                autoPlay: true,
                showControls: true,
              ),
              // Project name header
              Positioned(
                top: MediaQuery.of(context).padding.top + 16,
                left: 16,
                right: 16,
                child: Container(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(
                    horizontal: 16,
                    vertical: 8,
                  ),
                  decoration: BoxDecoration(
                    color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
                    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
                  ),
                  child: Text(
                    projectName,
                    style: const TextStyle(
                      color: Colors.white,
                      fontSize: 18,
                      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                    ),
                    textAlign: TextAlign.center,
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              // Interaction buttons (Comments and Save)
              Positioned(
                right: 16,
                bottom: MediaQuery.of(context).padding.bottom + 16,
                child: Column(
                  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
                  children: [
                    IconButton(
                      icon: const Icon(Icons.comment, color: Colors.white),
                      onPressed: () => _showComments(context),
                    ),
                    const SizedBox(height: 8),
                    SaveButton(
                      videoId: videoId,
                      projectId: '', // Pass or manage your projectId as needed
                      initialSaveState: true,
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              ),
            ],
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Maintainability:**  
  Each widget has a well‑defined responsibility, making it easier to manage and debug.

- **Reusability:**  
  The `VideoFeedItem` widget can be reused anywhere else in your app or extended with additional functionality.

- **Performance & Reliability:**  
  By isolating video playback and (if needed) moving preloading logic into its own service/provider layer, you reduce repeated instantiation and potential memory issues. If you choose a robust video player library or caching strategy later, you only have to update the underlying player widget rather than a tangled mess of page-level logic.

- **Scalability:**  
  As your app grows, you can more easily plug in additional features (e.g., analytics, dynamic UI adjustments) without having to modify a large, monolithic widget.

---

## Final Thoughts

While this refactor focuses on code organization, the next step could be to reexamine your video playback method. You might consider:

- Using a single shared video player instance that gets recycled as the user scrolls through the feed.
- Leveraging caching strategies (or preloading via a dedicated provider) so that only currently visible or near‑visible videos are initialized.
- Using established packages (like Chewie or a more robust implementation of `video_player`) to further reduce low‑level issues with video streaming.

By following these strategies, you can create a cleaner, more reliable video feed that is easier to maintain and extend.
